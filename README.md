##Fullstack Website Example
Thinkful capstone project that uses HTML5, CSS3 and React/Redux for the front-end; and ExpressJS and NodeJS as the webserver and MongoDB as the database.<br>
Sendgrid API is used to send emails to users who fill out the form for registration and to store their info in the Sendgrid contact database.<br>

This website demonstrates the form submission and data creation/storage using redux-form (https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) and mongoDB. I hope this will help people who wanted to see an example of form modals and submissions using React Redux.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
