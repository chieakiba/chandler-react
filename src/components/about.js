          <h3>It starts with passion, a burning desire to be the best. At Hoffman Pro Camps we are committed to working with those who embody this belief. Passion is waking up early to get that extra training session in, passion is studying the game instead of just watching it, passion is skipping out on a party to get the rest your body needs, passion is realizing that if you are not putting in the proper work there is someone out there who is. You bring the passion, we’ll help you achieve success.</h3>
          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <h3>Born in Birmingham, Alabama Hoffman played college soccer at UCLA between 2009 and 2011. During his time at UCLA, Hoffman was a M.A.C. Hermann Trophy semifinalist, NSCAA Third-team All-American, First-team NSCAA All-Far West selection, First-team All-Pac-12 honoree, Second-team CoSIDA Academic All-American, First-team Academic All-District and Pac-12 All-Academic. After his stellar junior season at UCLA, Hoffman was offered a Generation Adidas contract by Major League Soccer which he accepted. He attended the MLS Player Combine, January 6–10, 2012 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He then headed to Kansas City, Missouri for the 2012 MLS SuperDraft where he was selected in the 1st Round (13th overall pick) by the Philadelphia Union, becoming the first player from Alabama ever selected in the MLS SuperDraft. Hoffman made his professional debut on March 31, 2012 when he started for the Philadelphia Union in a regular season home game at PPL Park against the Vancouver Whitecaps. Hoffman scored the game winning goal in a friendly on May 9, 2012 vs. the popular European club, FC Schalke 04. On the eve of the 2013 season, Hoffman was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy for a conditional 2014 MLS SuperDraft pick.</h3>
